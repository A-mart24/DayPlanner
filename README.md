MY TASK:
This week I was tasked with creating a Day Planner. This Day Planner had to update the date on its own as well as have the timeslots change color depending on whether it was the past,present, or current time.

USER STORY:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
